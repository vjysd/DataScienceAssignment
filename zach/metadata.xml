What - data collected on when shuttles arrived at the Rensselaer Union, how long they
            took, and how many people boarded
Where - data collected at the closest red table to the right of the north entrance of the
              Rensselaer Union
When - data collected during most weekdays during the week of 2022-09-26

Why - Shuttle Tracker underperforms at tracking shuttles, observing when shuttles arrive
           at a popular stop like the Union may help understand how the shuttles operate
How - observation from the Union, recording data into Google Sheets when shuttles arrive,
           saving data as a CSV, using ISO 8601 for times
